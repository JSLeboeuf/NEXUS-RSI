# ðŸŒŠ NEXUS-RSI Wave Mode Implementation

## Overview
Wave Mode enables multi-stage command execution with compound intelligence, implementing Progressive, Systematic, Adaptive, and Enterprise orchestration strategies for the NEXUS-RSI system.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Wave Orchestrator (`wave/wave_orchestrator.py`)
Core orchestration engine managing multi-phase execution with checkpointing and rollback capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- 4 orchestration strategies (Progressive, Systematic, Adaptive, Enterprise)
- 5 standard phases (Review, Planning, Implementation, Validation, Optimization)
- Automatic complexity analysis and strategy selection
- Checkpoint creation for rollback capability
- SQLite database for wave tracking

### 2. Wave-Agent Integration (`wave/wave_integration.py`)
Bridges Wave Orchestration with the existing Multi-Agent System.

**Phase-Agent Mapping:**
| Phase | Primary Agent | Secondary Agents | Execution Mode |
|-------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Review | Quality | Security, Performance | Parallel |
| Planning | Performance | Quality | Sequential |
| Implementation | Quality | Security | Sequential |
| Validation | Security | Quality, Monitor | Parallel |
| Optimization | Performance | Monitor | Parallel |

### 3. Wave Dashboard (`wave/wave_dashboard.py`)
Real-time monitoring and visualization using Streamlit.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Wave execution timeline
- Strategy distribution analysis
- Phase breakdown with Gantt charts
- Live monitoring with auto-refresh
- Success rate metrics

## Wave Strategies

### Progressive Strategy
**Use Case:** Iterative enhancement and continuous improvement
- **Phases:** Review â†’ Implementation â†’ Validation
- **Iterations:** 3 (default)
- **Checkpoints:** Per iteration
- **Best For:** Refactoring, optimization tasks

### Systematic Strategy
**Use Case:** Comprehensive methodical analysis
- **Phases:** All 5 phases in sequence
- **Iterations:** 1
- **Checkpoints:** Per phase
- **Best For:** Security audits, complete system analysis

### Adaptive Strategy
**Use Case:** Dynamic configuration based on context
- **Phases:** Dynamically selected
- **Iterations:** Auto-determined
- **Checkpoints:** Adaptive
- **Best For:** Mixed complexity tasks

### Enterprise Strategy
**Use Case:** Large-scale orchestration
- **Phases:** All 5 phases
- **Iterations:** 1
- **Checkpoints:** Continuous
- **Features:** Parallel execution, distributed processing
- **Best For:** >100 files, multi-domain operations

## Complexity Analysis

The system automatically analyzes targets to determine:
- **Complexity Score** (0.0 - 1.0)
- **File Count**
- **Operation Types** (optimization, refactoring, security, etc.)
- **Domains** (frontend, backend, infrastructure, etc.)

### Auto-Selection Logic
```python
if files > 100 and complexity > 0.7:
    â†’ Enterprise Strategy
elif domains > 2 and operations > 3:
    â†’ Adaptive Strategy
elif complexity > 0.8 and 'security' in operations:
    â†’ Systematic Strategy
else:
    â†’ Progressive Strategy
```

## Database Schema

### waves Table
- `wave_id`: Unique identifier
- `strategy`: Selected strategy
- `complexity_score`: Calculated complexity
- `file_count`: Number of files
- `start_time`, `end_time`: Execution timestamps
- `status`: completed/partial/in_progress
- `phases_completed`: Progress tracking

### wave_phases Table
- Phase execution details
- Agent assignments
- Duration and status
- Results and metrics

### wave_checkpoints Table
- State snapshots for rollback
- Phase checkpoints
- Rollback capability flags

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Execution
```bash
# Run Wave Orchestrator
cd C:\Users\Jean-SamuelLeboeuf\NEXUS-RSI
python wave\wave_orchestrator.py

# Run Wave Integration with Agents
python wave\wave_integration.py

# Launch Wave Dashboard
streamlit run wave\wave_dashboard.py
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from wave_orchestrator import WaveOrchestrator, WaveContext, WaveStrategy

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = WaveOrchestrator()

# Analyze target
complexity, files, ops, domains = await orchestrator.analyze_complexity(target)

# Create context
context = WaveContext(
    wave_id="custom_wave",
    strategy=WaveStrategy.PROGRESSIVE,
    complexity_score=complexity,
    file_count=files,
    operation_types=ops,
    domains=domains
)

# Execute wave
results = await orchestrator.execute_wave(context)
```

## Integration with NEXUS-RSI

### Agent Coordination
Wave Mode coordinates the 4 specialized agents:
- **Performance Optimizer** (Sonnet)
- **Security Analyzer** (Opus)
- **System Monitor** (Haiku)
- **Code Quality** (Sonnet)

### Workflow Integration
Wave phases map to existing agent workflows:
- Review â†’ quality_analysis workflow
- Planning â†’ architecture_design workflow
- Implementation â†’ code_modification workflow
- Validation â†’ testing_validation workflow
- Optimization â†’ performance_optimization workflow

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Wave Success Rate:** Target >85%
- **Phase Completion Rate:** Target >95%
- **Average Duration:** <5 minutes for standard waves
- **Checkpoint Recovery Success:** >90%

### Real-time Monitoring
- Active wave tracking
- Phase progress visualization
- Agent coordination status
- Resource utilization metrics

## Benefits of Wave Mode

### 1. Compound Intelligence
Multiple agents working in coordinated phases provide deeper analysis and better results than single-agent execution.

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
Iterative waves allow continuous improvement with validation at each step.

### 3. Enterprise Scalability
Handles large-scale operations with parallel execution and distributed processing.

### 4. Fault Tolerance
Checkpoint system enables rollback and recovery from failures.

### 5. Observability
Complete visibility into multi-phase execution with detailed metrics and reporting.

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Machine learning for strategy selection
- Predictive wave planning
- Cross-wave learning and optimization

### Phase 3
- Distributed wave execution across multiple machines
- Wave templates for common scenarios
- AI-driven phase composition
